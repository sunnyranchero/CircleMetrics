# CircleMetrics
Written in C#. This is an Console App project for the class I am taking.

The goal of this project is to take an integer input for the radius and from there ouput the: diameter, circumference, and area of a circle.

Utilizes the following:
<ul>
<li>Try/catch error handling</li>
<li>String Interpolation</li>
<li>Setting a constant variable</li>
<li>Explicit casting of data types</li>
<li>Parsing a string input</li> 
</ul>
